# auctionrs

## Goals
- Create a client-server system for an auction network.
- The centralized server instance will be the entity resposnsible for keeping the data and managing bidding at auctions.
- Users are allowed to post their products and bid in other user's auctions.
- Ultimately, the system should correctly handle a big amount of users simultaneously bidding in products, with real-time updates of the values.

## Development
I will keep a record with the progress of the development of the tool. The idea is to start small, with a single user and no parallelism or APIs, so we can track progress and add features when necessary.
